## 10/19/2025 - Made the schematic of the keyboard.  

I finished making the schematic of the keyboard. It was pretty easy for me since I already tried making a keyboard before (kept making mistakes and gave up). I was originally planning to use RGB for the keyboard, but I decided to settle on normal LEDs since I'll probably just end up using one single solid color anyways.

## 10/21/2025 - Finished making the PCB.  

Laid everything out in the PCB editor and routed everything as well. Spent most of my time routing since I suck at organizing and planning ahead, so I kept making a mess. It turned out alright in the end though.

## 10/25/2025 - Got QMK and Vial working.  

This took way longer than it probably should've, but I suck at coding and have no experience so I expected that. Kept getting confused at some parts and made dumb mistakes cause I'm lowkey kinda slow.

## 10/26/2025 - Finished making the case.  

Somehow this was the most painful part of this project. I honestly thought I'd be done making the case in a few hours, but instead I spent them trying out other CAD apps and ended up settling on Shapr3D since I found it the easiest to work with and It ran pretty well on my PC (My PC is a shitbox).

6 hours for the most bland case possibleüôè

  

## 10/27/2025 - Added some stuff I forgot to add to the case.  

For some reason I never tried comparing the case to a 3d model of my PCB after I made the case so I did that today, and thank god I did. The pico was not fitting properly because of the plate so I added a hole for it to pass through and I also added a hole to the connector.
