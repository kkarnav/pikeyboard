## 10/19/2025 - Made the schematic of the keyboard.  

I finished making the schematic of the keyboard. It was pretty easy for me since I already tried making a keyboard before (kept making mistakes and gave up). I was originally planning to use RGB for the keyboard, but I decided to settle on normal LEDs since I'll probably just end up using one single solid color anyways.

## 10/21/2025 - Finished making the PCB.  

Laid everything out in the PCB editor and routed everything as well. Spent most of my time routing since I suck at organizing and planning ahead, so I kept making a mess. It turned out alright in the end though.
