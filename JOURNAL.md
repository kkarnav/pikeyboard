## 10/19/2025 - Made the schematic of the keyboard.  

I finished making the schematic of the keyboard. It was pretty easy for me since I already tried making a keyboard before (kept making mistakes and gave up). I was originally planning to use RGB for the keyboard, but I decided to settle on normal LEDs since I'll probably just end up using one single solid color anyways.
